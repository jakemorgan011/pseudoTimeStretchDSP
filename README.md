# pseudoTimeStretchDSP
a live input pseudo-time stretcher.
# HYPOTHESIS
okay so this will not work until quantum computers exist in handheld form.
i need to be able to lookahead into the future of live input. 
on already existing samples this already exists.

abandoning this project until i can buy a quantum computer from bestbuy.

# NOT YET WORKING
in need of a system that can dynamically loop the creation and deletion of x amount of buffers where x is equal to the numbe rof buffers needed for a full loop to be completed where both the writehead and read sync up at different speeds /september 2024 I solved this already but i can't make it work because i need to see the future for this to work.
